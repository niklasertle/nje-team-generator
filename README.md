## Description
This program was developed to be able to generate a team profile based on user inputs into the console. After following the install and usage guides the user is prompted for information about the manager of the team, which is used to create a manager card. After this the user is able to add an engineer, intern or finish the input. The first two options would allow for the user to add additional cards next to the manager's information. When clicking the email address for any of the created team members it will open a new window to email the selected user's email. For engineers clicking the GitHub username will open the profile in a serperate window as long as the account exsists. This app was developed using inquirer to be able to prompt the user and catch responses from the console, and uses jest to conduct testing.
